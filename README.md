# Using-the-Danish-Registers

This repo is relevant for users of the DST research server access under Michael E. Benros. The servers hold our access to and copy of the Danish registers. Our primary DST project is `708237`. 

The repo contains user guides and documents relevant for work on the registers and for exporting results from the DST servers for use in publications.

## Guidelines

1. [DST server export guidelines](/server_export/DST_server_export_guidelines.md) describes how to export results from the DST servers.
1. [Register guide](pre-processing/DSTRegisterDefinitions.md) describes important aspects of key registers
1. [Population description](/population/2022-10-21 Documentation of Register Populations on DST Project 708237.docx) describes the generation of the full Danish population on from various registry sources. Note that this documented is **outdated**, but it still describes relevant considerations about working on the registers. A new population is in use and its description is work in progress. For the time being, users with DST server access are guided to `ProjektDB/PSYK/Workdata/708237/02_data_derived_2023/reports/10_make_population.html` for further information.
